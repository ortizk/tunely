/* CLIENT-SIDE JS
 *
 * You will need this file for doing PUT or DELETE requests.
 * As an example, here is how one might implement a delete button
 * 1. Create a big red button that says delete. Give it an id.
 * 2. Listen for the click event on the button (using the id you made for it).
 * 3. In the function that executes on that click event, make an AJAX request to the server to
 *    delete the album. (Note: you will need the album id as part of the url)
 * 4. Make the route on the server side that accepts this request. Make sure it is getting there.
 * 5. Perform the deletion in the database
 *
